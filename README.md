# Old Breakout Game

# The backstory
When I was in middle school, I attended a summer camp run at the local vocational school called the Minuteman Computer Experience Camp.  The camp was run by one of the teachers at the school, Janine Baker, who sadly passed away some years ago. The way we learned to program in the camp was fairly self-driven. There were a series of lessons in BASIC, Pascal, and then C++.  you'd start with lesson 1 in basic and if you got stuck and needed help the counselors would help you. There were similarly structured robotics classes taught using the old LEGO Dacta system, and an outdoor athletics component.

In retrospect, the real value of the self-guided learning style is that it encouraged you to treat programming as something to be enjoyed and explored, rather than as an academic class to sit through.  I attended the camp every year i was in middle school, and worked ther as a counsellor through high school.  More than anything It taught me how to enjoy progrmaming. It started me down a path that lead to a career.

# The code

When I was 14, I picked up "packet 12" in the set of C++ lessons.  The goal was to write a breakout clone.  You were given a small stub function that initialized a graphics window, and some basic documentation of the old MacOS Quickdraw (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw) 2D graphics framework. At the end of the month long summer camp, I emerged with this code.  I printed it out before leaving and it languished in my parents basement for 18 years. This is an OCR scan of that paper copy.  Most of the typos are corrected, but theres probably a few left. 

I recall it working fairly well, though the maximum speed at which you could move the paddle was fairly slow.  Getting the collision detection to work reliably was by far the trickiest bit. 

It compiled on MacOS System 7 using whatever version of CodeWarrior ran on MacOS System 7.  It relied on a few sprites which have been tragically lost to time. 

14 year old me apparently didn't really understand the concept of local data, or function arguments, or objects. 

If you're reading this as a potential employer please know that my grasp of these concepts has improved somewhat over the past few decades :)
